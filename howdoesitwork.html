An ensemble of five pre-trained neural networks work together to compute the best personal advice for you. They look at your performance with respect to the performance of the rest of the team, for your last games. They look at your overall statistics such as previous season leagues, champion masteries, kda, etc. With this information, they are able to combine what they have learned by analyzing a large dataset of players and games in the League of Legends world to compute a relative score for each player. The gradients of all the inputs are computed and normalized by the usual gradients, and thus the input features which affect your score the most can be seen. In other words, for each input, such as kda, or champion picks, the algorithm computes the impact of each one, and displays iputs with highest impact. These are the features which should be the first focus of attention in order to improve gameplay.
