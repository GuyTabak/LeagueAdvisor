      <p class="lead">League Advisor requires no installation.
        All you need to do is input your summoners name into the prompt shown on the program UI.
        <br>
        After clicking on 'Scout', the advisor will start learning your playstyle,
         your strenghts and weaknesses. Once the learning process is finished you are now ready to use the rest of the features.
        <br>
        The coach will give you information about your best role, the champions you play best, relative to others on that champion, your strengths, such as "you die very little", and your weaknesses, such as "you don't place many wards." This will enable you to know what you should work on next.
        Also, if you are in champion selection, you can input your team and your enemy team's champion selections so far, and this will improve the quality of the champion recommendation given.
